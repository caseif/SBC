# SBC
The **S**tructured **B**lob **C**ontainer format is a specification for storing arbitrary binary data in a hierarchical
within a single byte blob. The full specification for the format may be found in the
[wiki](https://github.com/caseif/SBC/wiki/Specification) of this repository.

This repository will also house utilities for working with the format in the near future.

## Why?
Partly because I need a format for storing byte data compactly, and partly because it gives me the opportunity to
practice my skill in various programming languages.
